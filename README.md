# MorseNeuralNetwork

A system to decode an input Morse code bitstream into an alphabetic character display. The key element in this system is a feedforward neural network.

<b>Design</b>
The schematics for the design of the entire system can be found in the lab specs and problem sets (psets) with pictures and module descriptions.

<b>Implementation</b>
The project is written in Verilog using the Icarus Verilog 0.9.7 simulator on EDA playground. The design for implementation of the modules is found in the files Lab#Implementation. Wires and modules are labeled the same as they are in the Verilog code.
